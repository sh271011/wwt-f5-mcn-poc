# gcp_terraform

The terraform directory contains terraform build and variable files.  If the terraform build files will be called from the platform, additional customization is needed. Please reach out to the ATC core team for information on the customization.

The files in this directory are an example on calling terraform from the platform to build resources in AWS.
